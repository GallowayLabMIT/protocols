Attune operation
==============


Startup
-----------------

..  note:: Purpose: To make sure the lines are filled.
::


Run enhanced start up if > 3 days since the last run. Enhanced startup is just running "Startup" protocol twice. Then run performance test. 
If an instrument button is grayed out, try hitting refresh.  

1. Remove all plates from the Cytkick. 
2. Check autosample bottle connections
3. Focusing fluid has single "click" lock. 
4. Important: Waste bottle (black) requires a double "click" for lock 
5. Note: Connectors have disconnect "buttons" to release the connection. 
6. Important: Bottle sensors need to be plugged in for performance. Do NOT remove by pulling on line, remove by pulling on solid head of sensor connector. And do NOT force. 
7. Check the fluids inside the Attune. 
8. To fill the Focus Fluid, slide the bottle out and add fluid. Or remove entirely. Bottle must be dry to avoid trigger leak sensor. 
9. Run Debubble. Add 3 mL of Debubble Solution to tube and run twice. 
10. Performance test run daily but make sure to use original filter settings (not FP special filters)
 

Cleaning
-----------------
.. note :: Deep cleaning recommended once a week or every two weeks. Run with Hellmanex Solution.
::

Hellmanex can be used for deep cleaning. It is alkaline and viscous. 
To make Hellmanex Solution, dilute Hellmanex 1 mL into 2 mL DI water. 
Hellmanex Solution can be used in place of bleach for deep clean. 
Recommended for deep clean + shutdown. Requires a lot of subsequent flushing. 


Performance Check
-----------------

.. important ::Before running a performance check, make sure to check the filters. If a red stripe filter is in the instrument (not the side holder), it needs to be replaced with the correct filter or the peformance check will not pass. 
Verify lot # of performance beads. Lot # change every ~4 years and require a new set of download files for proper calibration. Originally set September 11, 2020.
::


1. Add 3 full drops of performance beads and dilute with 2 mL of focusing fluid (or PBS). 
2. After performance test, wash out bead with "Sip sanitize" and then wash solution.

================= ===========================


Maintainence
-----------------
.. important :: Maintainence required every 3-6 months
::

1. Check syringe (side of main attune instrument behind plastic panel) for build up of salt. May need to be replaced every 6 months. If salt accumulates, this can block sliding of syringe and preventing loading of sample. Part can be ordered and easily replaced by the lab, no need for technician. Syringe should be finger tight. Do not over tighten. 
2. Sip- The input straw can be bent. If bent, get part from Maintainence Kit, unscrew and replace. 
3. Focus Filters (2) should be changed ever 3-6 months. When switching out, wash with 10 mL Focus Fluid in a syringe to flush filter. 
4. Run Sanitize every 3-6 months.
