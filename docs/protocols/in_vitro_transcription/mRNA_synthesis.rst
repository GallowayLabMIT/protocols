mRNA synthesis
==============
This procedure outlines mRNA synthesis with Cap O structure, where IVT and capping is conducted sequentially, with lithium chloride purification steps after IVT and capping (i.e., IVT => purification => capping => purification).

This workflow is amenable to simultaneous IVT and capping using CleanCap AG reagent or Anti-Reverse Cap Analog `(ARCA) <https://www.neb.com/products/s1411-3-o-me-m7g5ppp5g-rna-cap-structure-analog#Product%20Information>`_, but this workflow 1) reduces yield of capped mRNA and 2) contaminates the product with uncapped mRNA, which elicits an immunogenic response.   

.. important:: 
  Please be careful to avoid `degradation from RNase <https://www.neb.com/tools-and-resources/usage-guidelines/avoiding-ribonuclease-contamination>`_. Although I haven't encountered noticeable RNA degradation, it's probably a good idea to adhere to some of these general guidelines. I recommend using a new pair of gloves each time you enter/exit lab. Also, use barrier pipette tips when handling any of the reagents (nucleosides, buffers, enzymes) to prevent RNase contamination for other users. 


IVT reaction
==========================
The protocol for IVT is adapted from the `standard NEB HiScribe protocol <https://www.neb.com/protocols/0001/01/01/standard-rna-synthesis-e2040>`_.

1. Recipe for Golden Gate reaction (total volume = 10 µL):

Purification of IVT reaction with lithium chloride
=======================================================
The protocol for lithium chloride purification is adapted from `Thermo <https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/ambion-tech-support/rna-isolation/general-articles/the-use-of-licl-precipitation-for-rna-purification.html>`_.

Capping of purified IVT mRNA 
================================================================================================
The protocol for capping is adapted from the `NEB Vaccinia capping system protocol <https://www.neb.com/protocols/0001/01/01/capping-protocol-m2080>`_.
