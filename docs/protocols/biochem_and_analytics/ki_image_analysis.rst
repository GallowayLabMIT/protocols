Image analysis using the KI workstation - Nemo
===================================================================

.. important:: 
    Before starting make sure you have been trained by the core staff about Workstation access. 
    This protocol is supplemental only to training provided by the core staff, and aimed maily for basic 3D reconstruction using Z-stack images. 
    More advanced analysis can be consulted from the core staff. 
    
This protocol aims guide users how to perform basic image processing, specifically 3D reconstruction from Z-stacks, using softwares installed at the KI Microscopy core workstation â€“ Nemo. 
At the time of my training, this workstation has 3 different softwares installed: Fiji, LasX and Imaris. 
All images acquired in Lecia Sp8, can be processed and analyzed by either of 3 softwares, 3D reconstruction from Z-stacks can be done better using LasX (Leica software) and Imaris. 
For simplicity, I've used the LasX 3D function to acquire Volume data, but use Imaris 3D visualization function for the representative reconstructed images.
