======================
Adherent Cell Staining
======================

Protocol
=========
1. Remove media and add cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) *(in fume hood)*
2. Incubate cells in 4% PFA for 1 hour at 4 degrees C.
3. Remove 4% PFA *(in fume hood)*
4. Wash cells 3 times with cold PBS. *(cells may be left in PBS overnight at 4 degrees C)*
5. **If staining nuclear proteins**, change solution and incubate cells in 0.5% PBS/Tween for **1 hour** to **overnight** at 4 degrees C.

.. note::
 1. Never remove all of the media from the cells-they will dry and absorb antibody in a non-specific way, thereby skewing your results.
 2. Do not breathe in the PFA; it is toxic!
 3. If mounting, try to avoid bubbles in the final step. Leave some solution still on your slides so the cells do not dry and carefully dispense 2-3 drops of the solution, very carefully putting the coverslip on your slide.
 4. Unless otherwise noted, everything is performed at room temperature.
 5. Keep your antibodies on ice at all times.
 6. Be very gentle with neuronal cultures, they are not very adherent.
