Adherent Cell Staining
======================

Solutions Required
==================
* **4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)**:
  For 10 mL of solution, 1.25 mL PFA (32% stock solution) + 8.75 mL PBS

  .. warning:: PFA is toxic! Always use PFA in the fume hood and do not breathe it in!
     PFA waste should be collected in the satellite accumulation area in the fume hood.

* **0.5% PBS/Tween**:
  For 50 mL of solution, 250 uL Tween + 50 mL PBS
  
  .. note:: Larger volumes of Tween are easier to measure because it is very viscous.

* **0.1% PBS/Tween**:
  For 50 mL of solution, 10 mL of 0.5% PBS/Tween + 40 mL PBS
  
* **Blocking Solution**:
  10% FBS diluted in 0.1% PBS/Tween


Protocol
=========
1.	Remove media and add cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) *(in fume hood)*.
2.	Incubate cells in 4% PFA for 1 hour at 4°C.
3.	Remove 4% PFA *(in fume hood)*.
4.	Wash cells 3 times with cold PBS. *(Cells may be left in PBS overnight at 4°C)*
5.	**If staining nuclear proteins**, change solution and incubate cells in 0.5% PBS/Tween for **1 hour** to **overnight** at 4°C.
6.	Change solution and incubate cells in blocking solution for 1 hr. *(You can leave your cells in blocking solution overnight at 4°C)*.
7.	Change solution and incubate cells in primary antibody (diluted in blocking solution) overnight at 4°C.
8.	Change solution and wash cells with 0.1% PBS/Tween quickly three times.
9.	Incubate cells in 0.1% PBS/Tween for 20min. *(You can leave your cells at 4°C in 0.1% PBS/Tween overnight)*.
10.	Change solution and incubate cells in secondary antibody for 1 hr (Secondary antibody is diluted 1:300-500 in blocking solution). *(You can incubate your cells in secondary antibody overnight at 4°C)*.
11.	Change solution and wash cells with 0.1% PBS/Tween quickly three times.
12.	If doing DNA stain, add Hoechst or DAPI diluted in PBS for 10 minutes, then wash three times with PBS.
13.	Either store in PBS or remove solution and add vectashield solution. Your cells can stay in the solution at 4°C for a long time before you image them, just make sure to parafilm the sides to the liquid does not evaporate.


.. note::
 1. Never remove all of the media from the cells-they will dry and absorb antibody in a non-specific way, thereby skewing your results.
 2. If mounting, try to avoid bubbles in the final step. Leave some solution still on your slides so the cells do not dry and carefully dispense 2-3 drops of the solution, very carefully putting the coverslip on your slide.
 3. Unless otherwise noted, everything is performed at room temperature.
 4. Keep your antibodies on ice at all times.
 5. Be very gentle with neuronal cultures, they are not very adherent.
