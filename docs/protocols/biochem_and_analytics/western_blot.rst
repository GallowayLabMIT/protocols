Materials:
----------
* 10X Cell Lysis Buffer from CST
* 200mM PMSF (200X concentrated)
* Cell Scraper
* Blunt 21 gauge needles
* Lock-joint syringe
* Cells to lyse

.. note::
   * If 10X cell lysis buffer will be continually used, it is recommended that the 10x buffer be kept at 4°C for 1-2 weeks. For longer periods of time, buffer should be stored at –20°C. Aliquoting of 10x buffer is recommended if many small experiments are to be performed.
   * PMSF is unstable in water and should be added to lysis buffers or other aqueous solutions just prior to use. Typically, a final concentration of 1 mM provides sufficient protease protection. Store lyophilized at RT for 24 months protected from direct light. Once in solution, PMSF can be stored at -20ºC for up to 3 months, protected from light.

Protocol:
---------

.. important:: All reagents and lysates must be kept cold.


1. Cool microcentrifuge to 4°C for 20-30 minutes.
2. Dilute 10X Cell Lysis Buffer to a 1X solution using Elga water.
3. Chill 1X buffer on ice and add PMSF just prior to use.
4. Wash plate with ice-cold PBS to remove residual media.
5. Add 400 uL of 1X lysis buffer to the 10cm dish of cells.
6. Incubate on ice for 5 minutes.
7. Scrape cells with a cell scraper.
8. Use 21 gauge needles to shear the cells 5-6 times.
9. Spin extract 10-12 minutes at 14,000 x g in the 4°C microcentrifuge.
10. Remove supernatant for use.


.. note::
   * Use prepared lysates as quickly as possible, and store for as short a time as possible. 
   * Store lysates at -80℃ for as long as possible. For lysates that will need to be kept around long term, transfer freshly prepared tubes to an available -80℃ freezer to prevent degradation.
   * Lysates have a shorter shelf life when stored at -20℃; long-term storage at this temperature is not recommended. CST recommends that lysates are stored at -20℃ for no longer than 3 months.
   * Minimize your freeze/thaw cycles as much as possible. Instead, aliquot into smaller volumes.


Bradford Assay
==============

Introduction
------------

The Bradford Assay is used for protein concentration quantification.
It utilizes Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 dye which binds to proteins and shifts the maximum absorption from 470nm to 595nm.
This absorption at 595nm can be measured using the NanoDrop.
The protein concentration can be estimated by creating a standard curve and using Beer's law.

Materials
---------

* Bradford Assay Reagent
* BSA Standard (2 mg/mL)
* Lysis Buffer
* Lysate Samples

.. important::
   Ensure that the Bradford assay kit is compatible with the lysis buffer.
   
   For example, the Bradford assay should be compatible with RIPA lysis buffer but is not compatible with the CST Cell Lysis Buffer due to high amounts of Triton.

   See `Bradford Assay Documentation <https://geneseesci.com/shop-online/product-doc/18-442?doc_id=1>`_ for the full list of compatible reagents.

Protocol
--------

1. Remove Bradford Protein Assay Reagent from the refrigerator and gently mix by inverting the bottle several times.
2. Aliquot the required volume of the dye reagent and allow it to equilibrate to room temperature before use.
3. Prepare diluted BSA protein standards. Be sure to dilute the supplied BSA standard (2000 ug/mL) in the same buffer as the test samples (e.g. 1x lysis buffer). Use the tables below as a guide for preparing a set of protein standards.

4. Combine each standard and unknown sample with the Bradford Reagent.
   
   * For a working range of 100-1500 ug/mL, pipette 1 uL of each standard or unknown sample into a labeled tube and add 20 uL of the Bradford Protein Assay Reagent and mix well.
   * For a working range of 1-25 ug/mL, pipette 10 uL of each standard or unknown sample into a labeled tube and add 10 uL of the Bradford Protein Assay Reagent and mix well.

5. Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes.
6. On the NanoDrop, select the Proteins tab and then Bradford Assay.
7. Enter the concentrations of each BSA standard and select the number of replicates.
8. Measure the absorbance of of each BSA standard as directed by the NanoDrop to construct the standard curve.
9. Measure the absorbance of each sample. The NanoDrop will automatically calculate the protein concentration for you based on the standard curve.
