CFSE Labeling
=======================
CFSE and other CellTrace dyes are used to measure relative 
proliferation rates of cells. These dyes are amine-reactive and cell permeable
and thus react with proteins within the cell. As cells divide, the dye is split
between the daughter cells and thus diluted through cell division. Lower CFSE 
signal is indicative of more cell divisions, relative to a reference population.

In our lab, we use CFSE and other CellTrace dyes to measure relative 
proliferation rates of reprogramming populations. Cells are stained the day after
transduction of reprogramming factors (1 day post-infection, 1 dpi). However, 
this protocol may be applied to any cell population where relative proliferation
rates are of interest.

Other materials needed:
________________________  
- PBS
- DMEM + 10% FBS
- Adherent cells to stain

    - For MEFs and reprogramming experiments, it's recommended to work in 24-well plates or larger to have enough cells for Flow quantification. 

Dilute Cell Trace Dye to working concentration 
-----------------------------------------------

1. If available, use an already resuspended vial of desired CellTrace dye. If unavailable, or not enough available, resuspend dye in DMSO according to the above table.
    
    - One entire tissue culture plate will require 6 mL of working concentration CellTrace Dye, so you will need 6 µL of stock dye per plate being stained.
2. Dilute stock solution of dye into PBS to make a working solution. Stocks are 1000x concentration. 


Wash cells and add CellTrace
------------------------------

3. Working in a BSC hood, aspirate the media and wash with PBS.
4. Aspirate PBS and replace with working solution of CellTrace.For control cells that do not get stained with CellTrace, incubate in PBS + 1:1000 DMSO or just PBS. 

    - For the CellTrace staining a "half" well volume may be used (e.g. 1 mL per well of 6-well plate, 0.5 mL in a 12-well, etc.)
5. Incubate the cells in CellTrace in the incubator (37°C) for 30 minutes. 

Remove CellTrace and wash
---------------------------

6. After incubation, aspirate the PBs solution and wash once with FBS containing media. 
7. Return cells to incubator and treat cells according to your experiment. For reprogramming, cells are harvested at 4 dpi and assayed via flow cytometry.
