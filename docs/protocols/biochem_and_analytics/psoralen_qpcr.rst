================================
Psoralen-qPCR supercoiling assay
================================

.. note:: This protocol was used for the experiments described in Babos and Galloway, Cell Stem Cell, 2019 for measuring DNA supercoiling using psoralen intercalation as a metric of negative supercoiling. Psoralen preferentially incorporates into underwound DNA (negatively supercoiled DNA).

Experiment setup
-----------------
1. Prepare half of a 6-well **plate** per replicate.
   For conditions in triplicate, this means **1.5 6-well plates** per condition!
2. Treat cells according to your experiment.
3. If you want to arrest the cell cycle prior to measurement, treat the cells with
   1 μM aphidicolin for 1.5 to 2 hours prior to cell harvest and DNA extraction.

Cell harvest and DNA extraction
-------------------------------
Single-cell acquisition
-----------------------
.. time:: 3-5 minutes per cell.

.. important:: All work should be performed with RNase free reagents!


1.	Cells should be plated on the lids of electrophysiology dishes to prevent interferences of dish sides with micromanipulator angle of approach. 
2.	Label PCR tube strips with numbers to correspond to the number of the cell picked.
3.	Add 5 ul of Cells Direct 2X rxn (Cells Direct One-step qRT-PCR kit , Life, Cat# 11753-100) mix to each PCR tube.
