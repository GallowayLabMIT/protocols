Prepare necessary buffers as described in :doc:`/recipes/fish/fish_buffers`
Expected time: 3 days if solution, 1 day if well plate

===================
Well Plate Protocol
===================

Well Plate Detection Stage
==========================
1. Steps 1-5 of :doc:`antibody_staining`
2. Wash samples 2x with 200 uL of 2X SSC
3. Add 200 uL of probe hybridization buffer for 30 min at 37 degrees C
4. Prepare probe solution by adding 1.2 uL of 1 uM stock to 300 uL of probe hybridization buffer at 37 degrees C
5. Remove pre-hybridization solution and add probe solution
6. Incubate samples **overnight (12-16 h**) at 37 degrees Celsius

Solution Protocol
=================

Solution Detection Stage
========================
1. Steps 1-5 of :doc:`antibody_staining`
2. Add 500 uL of probe hybridization buffer for 30 min at 37 degrees C
3. Prepare probe solution by adding 2 uL of 1 uM stock to 500 uL of probe hybridization buffer at 37 degrees C
4. Remove pre-hybridization solution and add probe solution
5. Incubate samples **overnight (12-16 h**) at 37 degrees Celsius
6. Remove excess probes by washing 4x 15 min with 500 uL of probe wash buffer at 37 degrees Celsius
7. Wash samples 3x 5 min with 500 uL of 5X SSCT at room temperature

Hairpin Preparation Stage
=========================
1. Prepare 30 pmol of hairpin h1 and h2 by snap cooling 10 uL of 3 uM stock at 95 degrees Celsius for 90 seconds
2. Cool hairpins in the dark at room temperature for 30 minutes
3. Prepare hairpin solution by adding h1 and h2 hairpins to 500 uL amplification buffer

Solution Amplification Stage
============================
1. Pre-amplify samples in 500 uL of amplification buffer for 30 min at room temperature
2. Remove pre-amplification solution and 500 uL of the hairpin solution
3. Incubate samples **overnight (12-16 h)** in the dark at room temperature
4. Remove excess hairpins by washing with 500 uL of 5X SSCT at room temperature for:
   a. 2x 5 min
   b. 2x 30 min
   c. 1x 5 min
5. Store at 4 degrees C in the dark until imaging
