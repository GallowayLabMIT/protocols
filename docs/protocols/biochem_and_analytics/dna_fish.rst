Fixation
========
1. Steps 1-5 of :doc:`adherent_staining` 

Probe Preperation
=================
1. Preheat Hybridization Buffer (HYB) to 37 degrees Celsius
2. Dilute probe stock with HYB to 10 pmol per 100 uL per reaction
3. Heat probe+HYB mixture at 70 degrees C for 5 mins
4. Chill on ice until use

Hybridization
=============
1. Preheat Hybridization Buffer (HYB) to 37 degrees Celsius
2. Incubate cells at room temperature for 30 minutes in 20% glycerol in PBS
3. Flash freeze the cells 
   a. Place coverslips in liquid nitrogen for 30 seconds
   b. Remove and let thaw for 1 minute
4. Incubate cells at RT for 20 mins in 20% glycerol in PBS
5. Repeat Step 4
6. Incubate cells at RT for 5 mins in .1 N HCl
7. Rinse cells at RT with 2X SSC
   a. Repeat x2
8. Incubate cells at 37 degrees C in 500 uL of HYB for 30 mins
9. Remove HYB and add 100 uL of probe+HYB mixture
10. Incubate at 78 degrees C for 5 mins
11. Incubate overnight at 37 degrees C in a humid environment

Post-Hybridization
==================
1. Preheat Hybridization Buffer (HYB) to 37 degrees Celsius
2. Preheat Probe Wash Buffer to 37 degrees C
3. Remoove probe+HYB, then wash with 500 uL of Probe Wash Buffer
   a. Repeat
4. Wash at RT with 5X SSCT for 5 mins
   a. Repeat
5. Wash at RT with PBS for 5 mins
6. Proceed to imaging
