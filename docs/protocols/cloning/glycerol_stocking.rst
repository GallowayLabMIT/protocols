Glycerol Stocking 
====================

After successfully sequencing a bacterial plasmid, we must stock it for storage. 

1. Add pKG # to Quartzy database. Add in a new item to the plasmid database, with the criteria below. The pKG number is XXXXX, use the next pKG number available. 

=============================== ====================================================
Criteria                        Label 
=============================== ====================================================
Item Name                       pKGXXXXX (put leading zero if neccesary)
Type                            bacterial stock
Date Stored                     date of storage
Plasmid                         description of construct (ex. LentiX-EF1a-mGL-BGH)
pKG#                            XXXXX
Plasmid type                    Selection from options
Resistance markers              Selection from options
Species                         Bacterial cell type (ex. NEB Stable)

2. Culture desired 4 mL of bacteria clone with the plasmid in LB Broth with the correct resistance antibiotic (overnight). 
3. Add 2 mL of 60% glycerol to the 4 mL of culture. Mix well. 
4. Aliquot 2 mL of the resulting mixture to three cryovials. 
5. Label each cryovial with pKG#, date, initials, and description of the construct. 
6. Put cyrovials in -80 C. Put one cryovial per box.
