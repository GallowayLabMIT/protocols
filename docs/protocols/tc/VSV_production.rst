VSV production
============================================================

Material
---------

- Cells.
- Plates.
- DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS
- PEI
- Plasmids:
  pCAG-VSVN (pKG00756)
  pCAG-VSVP (pKG00755)
  pCAG-VSVL (pKG757)
  pCAG-VSVG (pKG00758)
  pCAG-T7 (pKG00759)
  pVSV eGFP dG (pKG0760)

Procedure
---------

Day 1. Seed cells
-----------------------------------
- Seed HEK293T cells to a 6well plate (2ml of 5.0 x 10^5 cells/ml)(Plate_A).
- incubate@37°C

Day 2. Tranfection
------------------
1. Transfect the plasmids mixture to the cell on Plate_A through general transfection protocol:
==========     ===========
Plasmid        Amount of DNA
==========     ===========
pVSV eGFP dG        5μg
pCAG-VSVN         1.5μg
pCAG-VSVP         2.5μg
pCAG-VSVL         0.5μg
pCAG-T7pol          5μg
pCAG-VSVG           4μg
==========      ===========
2. Incubate the cells @ 37°C for 5-6 hours.
3. Remove the media and add fresh complete media (2ml/well of a 6 well).
4. Incubate @ 37°C for about 48hours.
5. After transfection, seed HEK293T cells to another 6 well palte or 10cm^2 dish for the following amplyfication process (Plate_B).

Day 3. VSVG tranfection for viral amplification
-----------------------------------------------
- There is nothing that you need to do on the first transfected HEK293T cells on Plate_A
1. If you amplify the viral particle that you collect at Day 4 with a 6 well plate scale, transfect 2μg of pCAG-VSVG to the HEK293T cells seeded on Day 3. If you use 10cm^2 dish for this, transfect 10μg of pCAG-VSVG to the HEK293T cells.
2. Incubate @37°C

Day 4. Collect the viral particle and amplify it with HEK293T
-------------------------------------------------------------
1. Remove the media from the cells on Plate_B (HEK293T cells transfected with pCAG-VSVG at Day 3., and add the supernatant of HEK293T cells on Plate_A.
2. Incubate @37°C for about 48-72 hours to amplify the viral vector in the cells on Plate_B.

Day 6-7.
---------------
- 1.	Monitor the cells for the development of virus induced CPE or GFP expression if you are making GFP-expressing VSV. When 40-100% of the cells show the signs, the supernatants can be harvested. Harvest the supernatants and remove cells and cell debris by centrifugation for 10min at 450xg or by filtrating the supernatant with 0.45μm filter.

Small tips
---------------
- If you see less GFP expressing cells at any process in this protocol, you can increase the incubation time as you need. Depend of the stability of the viral genome affect the recoery efficiency as the system completely relies on the viral replication in the cells.
