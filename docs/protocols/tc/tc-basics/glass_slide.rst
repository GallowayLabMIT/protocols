Glass slide cell culture

Cleaning Protocol *(optional)*
===================================
If cells are not attaching to glass slides try cleaning them. The commercially precleaned ones should not have to be treated like this.

1. Incubate coverslips overnight in 1N HCl on orbital shaker
2. Rinse in water at least 3 times
3. Wrap in foil and autoclave on dry cycle (30 min sterilization time)


.. tip::
	When mounting, aspirate most of the media off but leave some liquid to help detach the glass slide from the bottom. Carefully pick up slide with tweezers then place down on drop of mounting solution.
