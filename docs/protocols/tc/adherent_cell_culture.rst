General culture handling procedure
-----------------------------------
- Lift lid and tilt plate with one hand while aspirating/pipetting with the other.
- The lid should cover the plate as much as possible, providing just enough opening to perform the task
- The lid opening should face away from the hood opening (i.e., away from you and toward the back wall).
- Tilt the plate toward the back when aspirating.
- When aspirating, immerse the pipet tip in the media but don't touch the plate bottom until the very end to avoid aspirating away cells.
- Tilt media gently against the side wall of the dish to avoid dislodging cells.

Changing media
---------------
Unless you have very specific experimental conditions, it is good practice to check on your cultures
every 2 or 3 days and change media if the cells are not ready to be split or expanded.

Passaging cells
----------------
Passage number is an “indicator” of cells age. Every time the cells are detached from one dish and passaged into another dish , the passage number increases by 1.

1.  Aspirate away old media.
2.  Wash with PBS (*optional*)

    i.  Gently add PBS to the side of the dish/plate, not directly on the cells
    ii. Aspirate away PBS

.. note::
    Some types of cells do not require trypsin to detach (e.g. HEK293Ts, Plat-Es). In that case, just pipette up and down until cells detach. This looks like a thin film disappearing from the bottom of the dish/plate/flask.


3.  Add 0.05% trypsin (dilute in PBS, DO NOT DILUTE WITH ANYTHING WITH FBS!!!) to detach cells from the plate

    - Trypsin should cover the entire surface area, general volumes are as follows:

    ============================   =================================================
    **Culture dish/plate/flask**    **Approx. volume 0.05% Trypsin**
    ============================   =================================================
    10-cm                           1 mL
    15-cm                           3 mL
    6-well                          500 µL/well
    12-well                         300 µL/well
    24-well                         150 µL/well
    96-well                         why are you trying to trypsinize a 96-well o_o
    T-75                            5 mL
    T-182                           15 mL
    ============================   =================================================

    i.  Incubate in 37°C incubator for 3-4 min, keep checking cells to avoid over-digestion.

        - Detached cells look rounded and refractile under the microscope.
        - Different types of cells will require different incubation periods.
        - The stronger the trypsin (higher %) the faster cells will detach.

    ii. Neutralize with >2 volumes of media that contains FBS (e.g. neutralize a 1 mL 0.05% trypsin with >2 mL FBS-containing media).
    iii. Mix well by pipetting and make sure that all cells are detached.

4.  If needed, take a known volume of cells and count cells using hemocytometer.
5.  Seed new dish/flask with desired number or dilution of cells (make sure cells in the original dish are well resuspended before you take an aliquot to seed the new dish).
6.  Cultures should be labeled with cell line name, date, passage number and initials of the owner.

    - Certain cell lines also need passage # of antibiotic selection, e.g. "Plat-E, Blast/Puro @ P12"


Plating MEFs from Frozen Stock
--------------------------------------------------------

Materials 

    - Frozen vial of MEFs
    - Media (DMEM)

1. Add 10-20 mL of media and spin down. 
2. Remove media to remove DMSO. 
3. Resuspend in 5 mL of media. 
4. Use 20 µL to count with the hemocytometer.

    - Number of cells in one corner * 10,000 = # of cells / mL 

5. Plate 5-10K cells per 96-well well or 100-160K cells per 6-well well.


Laminin Coating 
---------------------------------------------------------

Stocks and supplies

    - 100x Laminin (1 mg/mL; stored -20 deg C)
    - PBS

Protocol

1. Add laminin to PBS. 
2. Add 2 mL laminin-PBS to each 6 well plate. 
3. Allow wells to set for 2-4 hours before removing excess.
