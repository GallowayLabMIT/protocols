General culture handling procedure
-----------------------------------
- Lift lid and tilt plate with one hand while aspirating/pipetting with the other.
- The lid should cover the plate as much as possible, providing just enough opening to perform the task
- The lid opening should face away from the hood opening (i.e., away from you and toward the back wall).
- Tilt the plate toward the back when aspirating.
- When aspirating, immerse the pipet tip in the media but don't touch the plate bottom until the very end to avoid aspirating away cells.
- Tilt media gently against the side wall of the dish to avoid dislodging cells.

Changing media
---------------
Unless you have very specific experimental conditions, it is good practice to check on your cultures
every 2 or 3 days and change media if the cells are not ready to be split or expanded.

Passaging cells
----------------
Passage number is an “indicator” of cells age. Every time the cells are detached from one dish and passaged into another dish , the passage number increases by 1.

1.  Aspirate away old media.
2.  Wash with PBS (*optional*)

    i.  Gently add PBS to the side of the dish/plate, not directly on the cells
    ii. Aspirate away PBS

.. note::
    Some types of cells do not require trypsin to detach (e.g. HEK293Ts, Plat-Es). In that case, just pipette up and down until cells detach. This looks like a thin film disappearing from the bottom of the dish/plate/flask.


3.  Add 0.05% trypsin (dilute in PBS, DO NOT DILUTE WITH ANYTHING WITH FBS!!!) to detach cells from the plate

    - Trypsin should cover the entire surface area, general volumes are as follows:

    ============================   =================================================
    **Culture dish/plate/flask**    **Approx. volume 0.05% Trypsin**
    ============================   =================================================
    10-cm                           1 mL
    15-cm                           3 mL
    6-well                          500 µL/well
    12-well                         300 µL/well
    24-well                         150 µL/well
    96-well                         50 µL/well
    T-75                            5 mL
    T-182                           15 mL
    ============================   =================================================

    i.  Incubate in room temperature or 37°C incubator for 3-4 min, keep checking cells to avoid over-digestion.

        - Detached cells look rounded and refractile under the microscope, and by eye the media might look cloudy as it fills with cells.
        - Different types of cells will require different incubation periods.
        - The stronger the trypsin (higher %) the faster cells will detach.
        - To aid in detachment, pipetting trypsin along the sides to "wash" the cells or tapping the side of the flask can help with physically dettaching the cells from the plate.

    ii. Neutralize with >2 volumes of media that contains FBS (e.g. neutralize a 1 mL 0.05% trypsin with >2 mL FBS-containing media).
    iii. Mix well by pipetting and make sure that all cells are detached.
    iV. Transfer to a 15 mL of 50 mL conical. 

4. Centrifuge at 400G for 4 minutes. Cells will pellet at the bottom of the conical.
5. Aspirate all media/trypsin, carefully avoiding aspirating the cell pellet. 
6. Resuspend pellet in 1-10 mL of media (volume is your choice.)
7.  If needed, take a known volume of cells and count cells using hemocytometer.
8.  Seed new dish/flask with desired number or dilution of cells (make sure cells in the original dish are well resuspended before you take an aliquot to seed the new dish).
9.  Cultures should be labeled with cell line name, date, passage number and initials of the owner.

    - Certain cell lines also need passage # of antibiotic selection, e.g. "Plat-E, Blast/Puro @ P12"


Plating cells 
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Follow steps 1-6 above for passaging cells. 
2. Count cells by adding 10uL of resuspended cells to a hemacytometer.

    - Number of cells in one corner * 10,000 = # of cells / mL 

3. Plate cells according to your experimental guidelines. Generally, for 80-90% confluent cells the next day:

========== ================= ===============
Cell Type    Well Size              # Cells
========== ================= ===============
MEFs        96-well               5-10K
MEFs        6-well              100-160K
HEK293Ts        96-well         25K-35K
Plat-Es    6-well                800K
========== ================= ===============

.. note:: 
   Plat-Es (only for virus production) and MEFs require plates gelatine-coated plates.

1. Excess cells can be added to a new T75 or T185 (effectively passaging the cells)

Gelatin Coating 
---------------------------------------------------------

Materials
    - 0.1% autoclaved Gelatin solution

Protocol

1. Add laminin to PBS. 
2. Add 2 mL laminin-PBS to each 6 well plate. 
3. Allow wells to set for 2-4 hours before removing excess. 

Laminin Coating 
---------------------------------------------------------

Materials
    - 100x Laminin (1 mg/mL; stored -20 deg C)
    - PBS

Protocol

1. Add laminin to PBS. 
2. Add 2 mL laminin-PBS to each 6 well plate. 
3. Allow wells to set for 2-4 hours before removing excess. 

Gelatin Coating 
---------------------------------------------------------

Materials
    - 0.1% Gelatin
Protocol

1. Add enough gelatin to coat the bottom of the flask or well (approx 1/2 of media needed for the well)
2. Let sit for 10 min at room temperature. 
3. Aspirate excess gelatin. Use for plating cells within 1-2 hrs maximum, otherwise gelatin may dry out.
