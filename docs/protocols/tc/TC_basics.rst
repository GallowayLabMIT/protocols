TC best practices
=================
When handling mammalian cells (aka tissue culture) always work in the Biosafety cabinet. Best practices are outlined below.

General Guidelines
--------------------
- All TC room equipment (e.g., tube racks, timers, EtOH bottles, gloves) should stay in the TC room. Also, outside equipment should not be brought into the TC  room unless absolutely necessary.
- Do not wear your TC coat into the bacteria area. The white coats should be primarily limited to use in the TC, the exception would be getting media from the fridge (Sven). 
- Discard gloves used for bacteria work before entering the TC room.


Getting started in the Tissue Culture (TC) Room
-----------------------------------------------

1.  Wash your hands.
2.  Don a fresh pair of gloves before touching things in the tissue culture room.
3.  If you have long hair, it is recommended to pull it back before starting TC work.
4.  Find your lab coat which should be singly hung on a hook (not stacked).
5.  Spray your hands with ethanol before opening the incubators or hoods.

Getting into a biosafety cabinet (BSC)
--------------------------------------

1. Pull up the sash and spray down the surface with ethanol to ensure a clean space.
2. Check the stocks of pipettes, pipette tips, and resupply anything that is low
3. Check the waste bottle. It should be clear or slightly yellow. If it is pink, add bleach. If the bleach is above the blue tapped line (~70% full). There are extra bottles in the cabinet near the sink. If the waste bottle needs to be bleached, you can switch out the bottle with a new bottle to allow the old bottle to be bleached. 
4. Optional: For ease of cleaning, place a clear trash bag or other disposable bag in the waste container. A trash bag is required for all BSL2+ work. 

.. note:: 
        - If you need to bring any extra materials (Clean pipettes, pipette aids, markers, tube racks, etc) into the biosafety cabinet, always spray down and clean with 70% ethanol.
        - Ensure the blowers and vents are functional (laminar air flow run) by waiting for the biosafety cabinet to say it is on. If the BSC alarm is going off the sash may be at the wrong height and must be adjusted.
        - Only have items you need in the BS cabinet- Having too many items in the BS cabinet interrupts the laminar air flow and can cause contaminants to be introduced into the BS cabinet.
        - Do not place items on the BS cabinet grill- this created a gap in the air laminar flow.

5. Check the media and cells before using the BS cabinet - turbid media usually means that the culture is contaminated. If suspected contamination see that section of this page.
6. Bring any cells and reagents you are working with into the BSC. Spray down outside of all bottles and tissue culture plates with ethanol, but be careful no ethanol gets into the filter cap of T75 and T185 flasks.


While in the BSC
-----------------

- The BSC is ordered from clean (left) to dirty (right) with clean tips and pipettes at far left and the dirty the waster container being at the far right. Order things appropriately for the work you are doing. If you don’t know, ask. 
- Use ethanol and Kim wipes to clean up small spills as soon as they happen. Wipe the bottom of plates before putting back into the incubators to limit liquid-mediated contamination. 
- Always keep reagent bottles, tubes and culture dishes/flasks closed when not in use.
- Do not work above/over open reagents/ bottle caps… etc. Open containers should be put far away from you such that no work is done above/over them.
- Be sure you are working INSIDE  the BS cabinet (minimum 3 inches from the grill)- not on or above the grill.
- Do not use your phone or computer while handling cells- this leads to contaminations!
- Do not block the air in-take vents at the front of the BSC and at the back of the BSC or the air flow will be disrupted. 
- Do not make a wall of tips which will block air flow. 
- Do not discard your cells with the media in them, aspirate media before putting them in the Biohazard waste.



Finishing up work in the BSC
----------------------------
1. Removing tissue culture plates and media. 
2. In order to minimize contamination and cross contamination, run ethanol or bleach through the aspirator tip after use.
3. Spray the surface with pre-empt followed by ethanol and then wipe down. The pre-empt is required for BSL2+ work. Pre-empt can be sticky so “rinsing” with ethanol can help remove residue that accumulates over time. 
4. Pull the sash down and allow the UV to run for one cycle (min 15 min). Following the UV cycle, trash can be removed and place in the biohazard trash bin. 
5. Again, wipe the surfaces with pre-empt and/or ethanol following the removal of trash. 
6. Check the liquid biowaste collection. If contents looks pink, add more bleach.
7. Remove lab coat. 
8. Discard gloves in biosafety solid waste containers (NOT the trash can).
9. Wash hands. 

.. note:: 
    If working with BSL2 (NOT BLS2+), you can discard the trash into in the biohazard trash bin before th UV cycle immediately after step 1, do not need to use pre-empt, and can skip step 5. 

If your cell culture is contaminated
------------------------------------
Media that appears cloudy/turbid or the clear presence of fungal growth indicates likely contaminated. If contamination is suspected:

1. Discard it immediately in a biohazard waste bin and close and change the bin. Change your gloves immediately. Decontaminate any surfaces the contaminated culture came into contact with using bleach or ethanol.
2. Clean any surfaces in the incubator where the contaminated culture was stored (Do not directly spray ethanol in the incubator, instead wet a Kimwipe with ethanol and clean the surface). 
3. Check the media bottle you used for the contaminated culture - if suspicious, discard the media. Change gloves again and continue working with the rest of your cultures.
