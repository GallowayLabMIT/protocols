TC best practices
=================

Getting started in the TC
-----------------

a.	Don a fresh pair of gloves before touching things in the tissue culture room.
b.	If you have long hair, it is recommended to pull it back before starting TC work.
c.	Find your lab coat which should be singly hung on a hook (not stacked).
d.	Spray your hands with ethanol before opening the incubators or hoods.

Getting into a biosafety cabinet
-----------------

a.	Pull up the sash and spray down the surface with ethanol to ensure a clean space.
b.	Check the stocks of pipettes, pipette tips, and resupply anything that is low
c.	Check the waste bottle. It should be clear or slightly yellow. If it is pink, add bleach. If the bleach is above the blue tapped line (~70% full). There are extra bottles in the cabinet near the sink. If the waste bottle needs to be bleached, you can switch out the bottle with a new bottle to allow the old bottle to be bleached. 
d.	For ease of cleaning, place a clear trash bag or other disposable bag in the waste container. A trash bag is required for all BSL2+ work. 
While in the BSC
-----------------

a.	The BSC is ordered from clean (left) to dirty (right) with clean tips and pipettes at far left and the dirty the waster container being at the far right. Order things appropriately for the work you are doing. If you don’t know, ask. 
b.	Use ethanol and Kim wipes to clean up small spills as soon as they happen. Wipe the bottom of plates before putting back into the incubators to limit liquid-mediated contamination. 

Finishing up work in the BSC
-----------------
a.	After removing tissue culture plates and media, spray the surface with pre-empt followed by ethanol and then wipe down. The pre-empt is required for BSL2+ work. Pre-empt can be sticky so “rinsing” with ethanol can help remove residue that accumulates over time. 
b.	Pull the sash down and allow the UV to run for one cycle. Following the UV cycle, trash can be removed and place in the biohazard trash bin. 
c.	Again, wipe the surfaces with pre-empt and/or ethanol following the removal of trash. 

Special notes
-----------------
a.	Do not block the air in-take vents at the front of the BSC and at the back of the BSC or the air flow will be disrupted. 
b.	Do not make a wall of tips which will block air flow. 
c.	Do not wear your TC coat into the bacteria area. The white coats should be primarily limited to use in the TC, the exception would be getting media from the fridge (Sven).
