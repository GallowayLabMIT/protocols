Protocol
--------
1.	Seed 293T cells at 20,000 cells per well on a 96-well plate 1 day prior to infection.
2.  Create a dilution of the virus stock in DMEM with 10% FBS

Example dilution for 1 column of 1 plate:

======    ==========   ========================
Row         DMEM        Added
======    ==========   ========================
1           30 uL       15 uL Virus stock
2           30 uL       10 uL Row 1 solution
...         ...         ...
8           30 uL       10 uL Row 7 solution
======    ==========   ========================

3.  Add 30 uL of diluted virus + 70 uL DMEM with 10% FBS to each well
4.  Record how many uL of the original virus stock was used in each well (can be calculated with `this excel file <../../_static/files/MOItemplate.xlsx>`__)
5.  Count and record the cells in 1 well of the plate at the time of infection
6.  24 hours later, move on to :doc:`/instruments/attune/attune_operation`
