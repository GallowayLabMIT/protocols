Transient 293T Transfection
===========================
.. deprecated:: 2021.11.24
	Please use the updated :doc:`virus_production` protocol going forward; the efficiency of the new protocol
	exceeds this protocol's efficiency by more than an order of magnitude! Plat-E retrovirus production
	should still use :doc:`plat_e_transfection`.

Protocol
--------

1.	Seed confluent 293T cells approximately 1-2 days prior to transfection.  Cells must be ~90% confluent for efficient transfection.
2.	Make a mastermix of PEI and Knockout DMEM as follows:

	a.	For *one 10cm plate*, add 53.34uls PEI (1mg/ml; 4:1 ratio) TO 1.33mls Knockout DMEM in a 50ml conical, mix, let sit for 5 minutes.

.. important::
	*Ensure* that you add PEI to KO DMEM, *not the other way around!*

3.	Add DNA to this MM as follows, then mix and wait 15 minutes:

	a. For *one 10cm retrovirus plate*, use 6.67ug viral plasmid + 6ug pIK-MLVgp + 0.667ug pHDMG.
	b. For *one 10cm lentivirus plate*, use 6.67ug viral plasmid + 6ug pPAX2 + 0.667ug VSVG.

.. tip::
	It's more efficient to make a master mix of the structural and packaging vectors (e.g. PAX2/VSVG or IK-MLV/HDMG) and aliquot that out.

4.	Add this to each 10cm plate *dropwise* and evenly around the plate, rocking the plate back and forth, side to side to mix.
5.	*After 24 hours*, change with 6.5mls fresh media (DMEM + 10% FBS).
6.	Harvest media after another 24 hours and replace with another 6.5mls fresh media. Store media from each virus/vector in 50ml conical at 4°C (combine media from both plates into same tube!).
7.	Harvest again after another 24 hours.  May add the media from the two plates into the 50ml conical already being stored at 4C.  After this second harvest, UV plates for about 30 minutes, then discard into biohazard.
8.	Keep virus in 4°C until :doc:`ready to concentrate <virus_concentration>`!

.. note::
	Retroviruses are stable at 4°C for 2-3 days, with lentiviruses being stable for 4-5 days.
