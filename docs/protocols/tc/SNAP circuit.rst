====================================================
Transgene expression control through ribozyme switch (96-well plate version)
====================================================

============================
Material
============================

- Cells.
- Plates.
- DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS
- PEI
- Small-molecule such as theophylline, guanine (please check the concentration that you will need)
  
=========
Procedure
=========

Day 1. Seed cells
-----------------------------------
- Seed the cells 2.5-4.0x10^4 cells/well of a 96-well plate.
- Incubate the cells onvernight.

Day 2. Tranfection
------------------
1. Transfect 100μg of a plasmid expressing transgene-ribozyme switch cassette/well with PEI by following general transfection protocol.
   (if your small-molecule or the solvent has cytotoxicity, using 1:3 ratio of DNA:PEI would be recommended: 0.3μl of PEI for 100μg of DNA)
2. Incubate the cell at 37℃ 5% CO2 for 4-6 hours.
3. Remove the media from the wells carefully to not lose the cells, and add 100μl of fresh media that contains the corresponding small-molecule such as guanine and theophylline. 
4. Incubate the cells overnight.


Day 3.
---------------
- After 24 hours post small-molecule treatment, you should be ready for microscopic analysis of flow cytometry.
- Twenty-four hours incubation with the small-molecule should be generally enoguth to measure the output (Transgene expression), but you can further incubate the cell for 48 hours or 72 hours: If you are measureing the output at 48 hours post small-molecule treatment, you have nothinng to do at day 3 and you are going to check the result at 48 hour post media change.
