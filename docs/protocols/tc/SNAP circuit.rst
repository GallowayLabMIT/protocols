============================================================
SNAP circuit (Transient expression at 96-well plate version)
============================================================


Material
=========

- Cells.
- Plates.
- DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS
- PEI
- Small-molecule such as theophylline, guanine (please check the concentration that you will need)
- output construct: plasmid expressing reporter gene-ribozyme switch cassette (e.g, pHAGE-UBC-mGreenLantern-p2g6)
- input construct: plasmid expressing SNAPtag conjugated with target protein (e.g, pHAGE-SNAP-tagBFP)
  

Procedure
=========

Day 1. Seed cells
-----------------------------------
- Seed the cells 2.5-4.0x10^4 cells/well of a 96-well plate.
- Incubate the cells onvernight.

Day 2. Tranfection
------------------
1. Transfect 100μg of input construct and output construct/well with PEI by following general transfection protocol.
   (if your small-molecule or the solvent has cytotoxicity, using 1:3 ratio of DNA:PEI would be recommended: 0.3μl of PEI for 100μg of DNA)
2. Incubate the cell at 37℃ 5% CO2 for onvernight 

Day 3. Small molecule treatment
-------------------------------

1. Remove the media from the wells carefully to not lose the cells, and add 100μl of fresh media that contains the corresponding small-molecule such as O6-benzylguanine or the solvent. 
2. Incubate the cells overnight for 48-72 hours at 37℃.


Day 5-6.
---------------
- After the small-molecule treatment, you should be ready for microscopic analysis or flow cytometry analysis.

Small tips
---------------
- In you use 293T cells for the experiment, you might want to be careful when you change the media as 293T cells are super easy to be detached from the plate especially you do the experiment with 96 well plate.
