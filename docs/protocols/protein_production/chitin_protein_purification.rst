Chitin-binding protein purification
====================================

.. warning::

  This protocol was attempted for Tn5 purification. This was unsuccessful,
  though possibly not because of this protocol.

.. note::
  Use *branched* PEI. Any branched PEI should technically work,
  though the product mentioned in the literature is `Sigma P3143 <https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/sial/p3143>`__.


Protocol
--------
1. Resuspend the cell pellet in lysis buffer plus cOmplete protease inhibitor, on ice. For every gram of cell pellet, use 10 mL lysis buffer.
2. Sonicate the resuspended cells, using 5 cycles of 30-second, medium-amplitude 50% duty-cycle sonication.
3. Spin to clarify the lysate using maximum centrifuge speed (14600 xg) for 30 minutes.
4. If the protein of interest has DNA-binding activity, add 1.2 mL/10mL **10% PEI** dropwise while stirring.
   Centrifuge at maximum speed for 30 minutes to remove bound DNA.
5. Incubate the supernatant with 10 mL chitin resin / 500 mL original culture. Tube rotate for 1 hour at 4C.
6. Wash with 10-20 CVs of lysis buffer.
7. Add cleavage buffer. Incubate at 4C for 48 hours.
8. Elute into separate 1 mL fractions.
9. Dialysize elution buffer into 2x dialysis buffer, followed by concentration.


Regeneration Protocol
---------------------
1. Wash the resin with 3CVs of stripping buffer.
2. Stop the flow, and soak the resin in stripping solution for 30 minutes.
3. Wash with an additional 10 CVs of stripping buffer.
4. Rinse with 20 CVs of water.
5. Equilibrate with 5 CVs of 20% ethanol.
6. Store the resin in 20% ethanol at 4C.
