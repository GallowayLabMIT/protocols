Day 2+: Content-specific trainings
==================================

In addition to the required basic orientations to lab safety and organization (see :doc:`Day 0 <day_0_setup>` and 
:doc:`Day 1 <day_1_in-lab>`), the lab has put together trainings on topics directly related to our research. Many of these 
trainings will be presented during IAP, and resources will be posted here for reference.


Core lab techniques
-------------------

(*Links to presentations to be added IAP 2024*)

- Molecular cloning
- Mammalian tissue culture
- Flow cytometry
- Staining and microscopy
- Data analysis tips & common approaches
- Introduction to genomics
- Introduction to gene expression modeling


Computational skills
--------------------

**General**

- Install :doc:`required software <day_0_setup>` and extensions
- :doc:`General software tips and tricks <software_tips_and_tricks>`
- Introduction to the :doc:`command line <the_shell>`

**Github:** All lab code is stored on Github for version control and sharing. Check out the following protocols to learn the basics 
and refer back to as needed:

- :doc:`Introduction to git <git_intro>`
- :doc:`Startup checklist <startup_checklist>` for working with a new repository
- :doc:`Computational environment check <environment_check>` to confirm that you can edit git repos
- :doc:`Contributor guide <../../contributor_guide>` for editing this protocol site


Research reading and writing
----------------------------

Reading literature, communicating your findings, and composing compelling visuals are key research skills to master. The lab has put together 
several trainings on these topics. The :doc:`"How to" training series <../training/index>` was presented in Summer 2021 and Summer 2023 to undergraduates 
(and other interested lab members). Additionally, Katie has put together a :doc:`Writing Guide <../../writing_guide/index>` relevant for academic 
writing at all levels (papers, proposals, etc.).

Journal clubs are another essential piece of reading and evaluating primary literature. Past lab journal club presentations are located 
in `this folder <https://mitprod.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/GallowayLab/Eugaj4o4lw5Egeyo9_lQmjIB8un7AnIkFoRDG5BQ0Btwaw?e=OQuJTU>`_. Additionally, 
during IAP 2024, lab members will present a series of journal clubs on all papers and review articles published by the lab (*more 
information to be added IAP 2024*). For a complete list of lab papers, see the `lab website <https://gallowaylab.mit.edu/publications/>`_ 
or Katie's `Google Scholar profile <https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=boemvUgAAAAJ&hl=en>`_.
