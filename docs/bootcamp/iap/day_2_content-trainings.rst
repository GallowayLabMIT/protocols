Day 2+: Content-specific trainings
==================================

In addition to the required basic orientations to lab safety and organization (see :doc:`Day 0 <day_0_setup>` and 
:doc:`Day 1 <day_1_in-lab>`), the lab has put together trainings on topics directly related to our research. Many of these 
trainings will be presented during IAP, and resources will be posted here for reference.


Core lab techniques
-------------------

(*Links to presentations to be added IAP 2024*)

- Molecular cloning
- Mammalian tissue culture
- Flow cytometry
- Data analysis best practices
- Introduction to genomics
- Introduction to gene expression modeling


Computational skills
--------------------

**General**

- Install :doc:`required software <day_0_setup>` and extensions
- :doc:`General software tips and tricks <software_tips_and_tricks>`
- Introduction to the :doc:`command line <the_shell>`

**Github**
  
All lab code is stored on Github for version control and sharing. If you aren't familiar with Git, check out the
:doc:`Introduction to Git <git_intro>` and associated resources. The Git repository :doc:`startup checklist <startup_checklist>` 
is good to reference each time you clone a Git repo. Finally, complete the :doc:`computational environment check <environment_check>` 
to confirm that you can edit Git repos (including this protocols site!).


Research reading and writing
----------------------------

Reading literature, communicating your findings, and composing compelling visuals are key research skills to master. The lab has put together 
several trainings on these topics. The :doc:`"How to" training series <../training/index>` was presented in Summer 2021 and Summer 2023 to undergraduates 
(and other interested lab members). Additionally, Katie has put together a :doc:`Writing Guide <../../writing_guide/index>` relevant for academic 
writing at all levels (papers, proposals, etc.).

Journal clubs are another essential piece of reading and evaluating primary literature. Past lab journal club presentations are located 
in `this folder <https://mitprod.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/GallowayLab/Eugaj4o4lw5Egeyo9_lQmjIB8un7AnIkFoRDG5BQ0Btwaw?e=OQuJTU>`_. Additionally, 
during IAP 2024, lab members will present a series of journal clubs on all papers and review articles published by the lab (*more 
information to be added IAP 2024*). For a complete list of lab papers, see the `lab website <https://gallowaylab.mit.edu/publications/>`_ 
or Katie's `Google Scholar profile <https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=boemvUgAAAAJ&hl=en>`_.
