Day 1: First day in lab
=======================

Before your first day in lab, be sure to complete required trainings and download lab software, as described in
:doc:`Day 0: Software training and setup <day_0_setup>`. Once you have lab access, complete the list below to become oriented to lab processes and procedures.

Onboarding form 
---------------

Complete the tasks on the lab 
`Onboarding Form <https://mitprod.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/GallowayLab/EVMPYzgt5mxJqJibaW7MGA0BN9E3s3tIBzDVc-kutuT-7A?e=TFwYtM>`_. 
Have your mentor (or another lab member) check off each one. This list includes:

- Given access to lab software accounts (requested in :ref:`Day 0 <software>`)
- Added the lab printer (``stephenie``)
- Have appropriate card and key access to the lab 
- Acquired a lab notebook
- The two in-lab trainings described in the following sections

Lab-specific safety training
----------------------------

After completing all other safety trainings online, meet with the lab EHS rep to learn the relevant safety features of our lab (e.g., 
location of eyewash stations, processes for chemical waste disposal). To confirm that you understand these procedures, you must submit a 
Google form to be checked off by the lab EHS rep. This safety information is :doc:`documented here <../../general/lab_safety>`, and key 
points are highlighted in the 
`IAP 2024 lab-specific training slides <https://mitprod.sharepoint.com/:p:/s/GallowayLab/EW0UpzVQxgVDsnZOqmIS-sQBGbnor3MEVkoWMS2K6cmLwg?e=C8s5PY>`_.

Lab citizenship 
----------------

It is essential for lab members to display common courtesy and follow established procedures to ensure the lab runs smoothly. Professor Galloway 
expects all lab members to contribute to the lab mission and uphold lab values, as described on the 
`lab website <https://gallowaylab.mit.edu/bts/>`_ and internally 
`here <https://mitprod.sharepoint.com/:p:/s/GallowayLab/EX3IEiFinshLuxgMlo7OOFcBP6OPoIPMCpJyrZk4CTOvmA?e=ToEa1S>`_ (IAP 2024). 
On your first day in lab, a current lab member will walk you through the lab space and our digital organization.

Selected lab protocols to be familiar with:

- :doc:`Lab safety <../../general/lab_safety>`
- :doc:`Ordering materials and reagents <../../general/ordering>`
- :doc:`Receiving orders <../../general/receiving>`
- :doc:`Recycling <../../general/recycling>`
- :doc:`Cleaning and autoclaving <../../general/clean_autoclave_guideline>`
- :doc:`Basic TC procedures <../../protocols/tc/tc-basics/TC_basics>`
- :doc:`Virus safety <../../protocols/tc/virus/virus_safety>`


Core facility access
--------------------

If you anticipate using a core facility (e.g., flow sorter, confocal microscope, plate reader) check out the :doc:`relevant protocol <../../instruments/index>` to obtain 
access. It's best to start this process early, since obtaining access may take several weeks---training can be difficult to schedule during busy times, 
and you may be required to book supervised time on equipment before independent access is permitted.
