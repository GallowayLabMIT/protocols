1.  Create some change to a file in this repository; just really mash the keyboard,
    add this change, and commit it (New commit #1)
2.  Make a second change to **another location** in the same file,
    add, and commit it. (New commit #2).
3.  Using ``git log`` or any other tool, find name of New commit #1, and revert it.
4.  Use a selective ``git checkout`` to checkout the version of the file prior to
    New commit #1 (e.g. before you edited it for this exercise).
5.  Commit this change.
6.  You've now made four commits. What does your ``git log`` look like?


Selective git checkout syntax:
git checkout <snapshot/commit to take from> <files to check out>

git checkout <branch/commit name>

Revert syntax:
git revert <commit name>
