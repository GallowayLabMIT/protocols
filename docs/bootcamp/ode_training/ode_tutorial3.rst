On your own:

1.	How does changing the amount of enzyme ([*E_T*]) affect the rate of product formation (*dP/dt*)?
2.	How does changing kcat affect the rate of product formation (*dP/dt*) when the amount of substrate is small? When the amount of substrate is large?
3.	Optional: Using MATLAB or Python, plot rate of product formation (*dP/dt*) as a function of the amount of substrate ([*S*]). How does this curve change as *K_M* increases?
