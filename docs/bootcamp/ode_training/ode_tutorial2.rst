On your own:

1.	How does increasing *alpha_m* affect the steady state mRNA and protein levels? Use the provided code to plot mRNA and protein levels over time for several different values of *alpha_m*.
2.	How does increasing *alpha_p* affect the steady state mRNA and protein levels? Increasing *beta_m*? Increasing *beta_p*? Choose one of these parameters (*alpha_p*, *beta_m*, or *beta_p*) and plot mRNA and protein levels over time for several different values of that parameter.
3.	Optional: How does increasing *beta_p* affect the response time of the system (the time for mRNA or protein levels to reach steady state)? Hint: Plot mRNA or protein levels over time normalized to their steady state values.
