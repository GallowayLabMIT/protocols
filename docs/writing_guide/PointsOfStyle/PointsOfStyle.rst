Hyphenation
===================

Compound nouns that function as adjectives should be hyphenated. 
For example:
Cell-state promoter is hyphenated because it's an adjective... but when using cell state as a noun (as in "wow, look at that cell state!") it is not hyphenated

How to write gene and protein names?
===================
TL;DR: Genes are italicized. Human genes are all caps, Mice are first cap only, Mammalian proteins are always all caps.

References
===================
You can use different reference styles. If you’re submitting a paper, you should check which format is preferred. In general, if you use the box format like Science does the box reference is inside the period as shown here [2-4]. If you use name format like the Cell journals, here is the style (Last et al., 2012). If you want the foot-note like style, it’s outside the period like this.2-4
