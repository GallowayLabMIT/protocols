===================
Autoclave station
===================

Glassware and plastics are autoclaved as needed. Usually, this amounts to twice a week. Clean glassware on the drying rack will be autoclaved as well as any empty tip or tube boxes. 

Erlenmeyer flasks
-------------------

- Erlenmeyer flasks used for midipreps should be bleached at your personal lab bench. 
- After bleaching, flasks can emptied into the sink and washed with soap and water. 
  - We currently use Alconox as our soap. Alconox is stored as a powder underneath the sink. Dilute this powder in water in the squirt bottle labeled "Alconox"
- After washing, flasks should be placed on the drying rack. 

Tip boxes
-----------

- When a box of tips is emptied, throw away the empty plastic insert and autoclave tape and place the empty box in the area next to the Elga water dispenser. 

Tube containers
----------------

- When a container of 1.7 mL tubes is emptied, throw away the autoclave tape and place the empty container in the area next to the Elga water dispenser.

Media bottles
--------------

- If you empty a media bottle (Media, PBS, gelatin, Elga water, etc.), you are responsible for washing it. 
- If you cannot wash the bottle immediately, keep the bottle on your personal lab bench. 
- Clean and dry bottles will be removed from the drying rack and placed on the storage shelves when dry autoclave runs are being prepared.
