Cleaning BSCs
=================

As part of quarterly lab jobs, the biosafety cabinets (BSCs) used for TC should be thoroughly cleaned. This includes:

1. Remove any unnecessary items from the BSC, such as stray tubes or extra plastic tube racks.
2. Clean the walls and work surface: Use the dedicated Swiffer with paper towels (in place of where the Swiffer pad/towel would go) to clean the back and side walls and work surface of the BSC. Spray with Pre-empt and wipe, then spray with 70% ethanol and wipe to remove the Pre-empt residue.
3. Clean all items in the BSC: Spray all items in the BSC thoroughly with Pre-empt and wipe, then spray with 70% ethanol and wipe to remove the Pre-empt residue.
4. Clean the sash: Spray the inside and the outside of the sash with 70% ethanol and wipe with a paper towel.

.. tip::
    It is convenient to clean one half of the BSC at a time, i.e., move all items to the left side and wipe the right walls and surface, then move items from the left to right side as they are cleaned, then clean the left walls and surface.

.. note::
    Do your best to scrub away any stains or residue on the BSC surfaces, but note that the BSC in 66-219 has some permanent stains that will not come off.
