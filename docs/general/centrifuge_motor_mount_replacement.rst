Replacing microcentrifuge motor mounts
======================================

The microcentrifuges have rubber motor mounts which can dry up and crack over time. This causes the rotors to be off-balance and very loud when the centrifuge is turned on. Replacing these rubber motor mounts cuts down on noise and extends the lifetime of the instrument.

Procedure
---------
1. Remove the rotor from the body of the microcentrifuge by unscrewing the nut in the center of the rotor.
2. Unscrew the four side screws and carefully lift off the outer shell, setting it to the right of the main body. Take special care not to disrupt any of the electronics.
3. Replace the three motor mount assemblies with new parts as described above.
4. Put the outer shell, side screws, and rotor back into place. Take care not to press down hard on the rotor as this can cause the rubber mounts to split.
