Cleaning and autoclaving guidelines
====================================


.. important::
	Under no circumstance should dirty glassware be left in the sink or in the autoclave station. All items around that area should be assumed to be clean for autoclaving.


Autoclaving
-------------------

Glassware and plastics are autoclaved as needed. Usually, this amounts to twice a week. Clean glassware on the drying rack will be autoclaved as well as any empty tip or tube boxes. 

- For dry cycles: Gravity >> 20 min / 20 min (~45 min)
- For wet cycles: Liquid >> 30 min / 0 min (~1 hr)


Washing glassware
---------------------

  - We currently use Alconox as our soap. Alconox is stored as a powder underneath the sink. Dilute this powder in water in the squirt bottle labeled "Alconox". There is no precise measurement for this.	

  .. note::
    If you empty a glass bottle or flask (media, PBS, gelatin, ELGA water, etc.), *you are responsible for washing it.*. If you cannot wash the bottle immediately, keep the bottle on your personal lab bench.



   1. If you had cells in it (e.g. midipreps) use 10% bleach for 15 min, first before soap and water
   2. Rinse thoroughly with tap water until no soap bubbles are left
   3. Quick rinse with DI
   4. Put glass to dry on drying rack
   5. Move glassware when dry to the shelving with the other dry, clean glassware


Tip boxes
-----------

- When a box of tips is emptied, recycle the empty plastic insert and autoclave tape and place the empty box in the area next to the ELGA water dispenser.
- Filter tip boxes do not need to be reused and the whole thing can be recycled when empty.

Tube containers
----------------

- When a container of 1.7 or 0.6 mL tubes is emptied, throw away the autoclave tape and place the empty container in the area next to the ELGA water dispenser.


Washing glass beads for cloning
------------------------------------

 .. note::
    The dirty bead box should always be filled with 10% bleach

- Dump out beads+bleach into mesh strainer
- Rinse with tap water
- Soap with alconox water and then rinse
- Let beads dry in strainer overnight
- Use funnel to put beads into glass jar for autoclaving


Glass pipettes
------------------------------------

- Make sure no glass shards remain (shake out over sharps container)
- Carefully fill metal containers with glass pipettes with the thin end pointing down into the longer end (i.e. larger handle side points outwards when you open it)
- Seal with autoclave tape


Toothpicks
------------------------------------

- Fill container with toothpicks
- Cover with foil and mark with autoclave tape
