========================
LB (Amp/Kan) plate
========================


1. Dissolve 32 g of LB agar powder in 800 mL of sterile/ELGA water.  
   (4g of LB agar powder in 100 mL)
2. Autocleave it for 20 min at 121C.
3. Cool it to about 45-50C by letting it sit on a bench (room temperature).

.. tip::
  If you can keep touching it with bare hands, that indicates the temperature of the LB is around 45-50C and it's time to add antibiotics.

1. Add 800 uL of 1000x antibiotics to the autocleaved LB agar-water. 
2. Dissolve the antibiotics by stirring with a stirrer.
3. Pour 30-35ml of the antibiotics-containing LB per a petri dish.
   
.. tip::
  You can use a pipette but the LB can easily become solid so pouring LB by hand might be a good alternative method. 

8. Incubate the plate at RT until the LB agar become solid (normally it takes about 30-45min).
9. After the LB agar become solid, put the plates back to a bag and store it at 4C.
