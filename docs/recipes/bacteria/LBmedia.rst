========================
LB (Amp/Kan) plate
========================


1. Dissolve 32 g of LB agar powder in 800 mL of sterile/ELGA water.  
   (4g of LB agar powder in 100 mL) 
2. Autocleave it for 20 min at 121C.
3. Cool it to about 45-50C (if you can keep touching it with bare hand, then it is about that temperature).
4. Add 800 uL of 1000x antibiotics to the autocleaved LB agar-water. 
5. Dissolve the antibiotics by stirring with a stirrer.
6. Pour 30-35ml of the antibiotics-containing LB per a petri dish.
   (you can use a pippet but the LB is easily get solid so pouring LB by hand might be a good alternative method)
7. Incubate the plate at RT until the LB agar become solid (normally it takes about 30-45min).
8. After the LB agar become solid, put the plates back to a bag and keep it at 4C.
