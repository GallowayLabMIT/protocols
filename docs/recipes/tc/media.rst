================= =========== ===============

Add the following small molecules to small volumes
immediatly before media addition, to a **final volume of 10 ng/mL**:

* GDNF, from 1,000x stock (10,000 ng/ml)
* BDNF, from 1,000x stock (10,000 ng/ml)
* CNTF, from 1,000x stock (10,000 ng/ml)
* FGF10, from 10,000x stock (100,000 ng/ml)
* RepSox, **if in human cells**, from 1000x stock.

.. admonition:: TODO
To make 1000X stocks of neurotrophics, make a BSA solution (ONLY use (Millipore Sigma, A2058)). 

Make filtered 0.1%BSA/PBS. 
For Neurotrophic factors, from the reagents in the glass tubes

1.	To make 1000X stocks of neurotrophics, make a BSA solution (ONLY use (Millipore Sigma, A2058)). 

2. Make a 100ug/ml master stock for long term -80 storage using filtered 0.1%BSA/PBS. 

3.	You may (depends on what your working concentration is) further dilute them to 10ug/ml as a -20 stock using the same solution. 

4.	For the FGF, it is recommended that you use the same filtered 0.1%BSA/PBS to make a 100ug/ml -80 stock. 

5.	You may (depends on what your working concentration is) further dilute them to 10 or 20 ug/ml as a -20 stock using the same solution. For FGF, it is possible to just use sterile PBS.
