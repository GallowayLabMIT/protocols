Materials
---------

- **Linear** PEI (located in "Chemicals" tray in Oaken 4ºC)
- Hydrochloric acid (HCl), to balance pH
- Elga water
- 0.22 µm filter (recommended 500 mL size)

.. warning::
    Ensure you use the **linear** PEI, not the branched version!

Dissolve and Aliquot PEI
------------------------

1. Before beginning, rinse all glassware and stir bar with Elga water.
2. In a beaker on a stir plate, combine 1 mg PEI powder per 1 mL Elga water.
3. While stirring, slowly add HCl to dissolve the PEI and achieve a final pH of 7.0.

   - PEI will not dissolve well in a basic solution, so slowly add acid to facilitate this process.
   - Add acid a few drops at a time to not overshoot. Total acid required is ~1 mL of 2.5M HCl.
   - After each addition, wait several minutes for the solution to stabilize. After pH 7.0 is reached, wait an extra 10 min to ensure the pH has not drifted.

4. In a BSC, filter sterilize the PEI solution through a 0.22 µm filter (the 500 mL ones are appropriate).
5. Make 1 mL aliquots of PEI in sterile 1.7 mL Eppendorf tubes.
6. Store the aliquots in Elsa (-80ºC, top shelf). Determine the optimal PEI ratio before use.
