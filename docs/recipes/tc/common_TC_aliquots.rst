1,000X Neurotrophic factor stocks
---------------------------------

.. important::
    Dissolve neurotrophics into 0.1% BSA/PBS only, using **BSA, Millipore Sigma, A2058**.
    For the FGF, it is possible to do sterile PBS but it is recommended that you use the same filtered 0.1% BSA/PBS 

===================== ==============================
Neurtrophic            Cat        
===================== ============================== 
BDNF                   R&D Systems 248-BDB-050
CNTF                   R&D Systems 257-NT-050
GDNF                   R&D Systems 212-GD-050
FGF                    PeproTech 100-18B
===================== ============================== 

For Neurotrophic factors, from the reagents in the glass tubes:

1.  Make a 0.1% BSA/PBS **(ONLY use Millipore Sigma, A2058)** solution and syringe filter through a 0.2 µm filter
2.  Add 500 µL filtered 0.1% BSA/PBS to a 50 µg bottle of neurotrophics to get a 100 µg/ml (10kx) master stock

**For FGF only**

3.  Make 10 µL of 10kx master stock aliquots for long term -80°C storage
    
    - You'll end up with ~50 of 10kx aliquots

**For BDNF, CNTF, GDNF only**

4. Make 90 µL of 10kx master stock aliquots using for long term -80°C storage

    - You'll end up with ~5.5 of 10kx aliquots

5.	For BDNF, CNTF, GDNF only, *directly* add 810 µL filtered 0.1% BSA/PBS to the 90 µL 10kx master stock to make 10 µg/ml (1,000x) stock aliquots
   
    - For the last half 10kx master stock aliquot, you'll have to manually measure it day of to know how much BSA/PBS to add. e.g. 35.8 µL will need 322.2 µL.

6.  Make 50 µL aliquots for medium term -20°C storage
    
    -  You'll end up with ~18 of 1,000x aliquots (2 rows of a cardboard box)
    -  Leave the last aliquot for short term use in 4°C 
    -  You can use the full 50 µL -20°C aliquots to directly make 50 mL N3 aliquots for reprogramming experiments


RepSox
-----------------

===================== ============
Property                            
===================== ============ 
 Selleck Chem #         S7223
 MW                     287.32                 
 1000x stock            7.5 mM          
 Final concentration    7.5 uM         
===================== ============ 

1. To make working 1,000x stock (7.5 mM), resuspend 25 mg RepSox in 11.6 mL DMSO. 
2. Aliquot 50 uL in 600 uL tubes and store at -20°C in a labeled box. 


Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) Aliquots
------------------------------------
- FBS contains many nutrients and growth factors to support cell growth. To preserve FBS, it is usually stored in the -20°C freezer until used. To avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles of FBS and to prevent contaminations we make FBS aliquots.
- Thaw 500mL FBS bottle in the fridge overnight
- Make 10 aliquots of 50mL each. Be sure to stop at the 50mL mark. Having larger volumes may cause the FBS to overflow (and be contaminated) when frozen again (FBS volume expands when frozen).
- Store aliquots in -20°C freezer in the TC room.
- Take responsibility for aliquoting new stocks, when older stocks are almost used up. Make sure to use sterile technique in preparing aliquots.

.. note::
    This is now a lab job. As of 6/21/22, notify Sneha if more aliquots need to be made.


Pen-strep aliquots
---------------------
- Penicillin-streptomycin is a mixture of penicillin and streptomycin and is added to the media to prevent bacterial contamination. However, it is always important to be very careful when handling cultures as contamination may still occur even when pen-strep is added.
- Thaw 50mL pen-strep bottle in the fridge overnight
- Pen-strep is aliquoted into 5mL aliquots and stored in the TC -20°C until used.
- Take responsibility for aliquoting new stocks, when older stocks are almost used up. Make sure to use sterile technique in preparing aliquots.
